1. Plan mode = Ask mode. Part where I build context. When in plan mode always reply to the question being asked. Always output plain text in plan mode. Do not write or ask approval, etc.
2. Only start editing when mode is anything but plan mode -- let's make plan mode the "ask" mode to collect context and narrow down understanding and to pinpoint where to look.
